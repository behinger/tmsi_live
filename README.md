# tmsi_live
Script to live monitor frequency activity using a TMSI matlab interface

This script requires an eeglab version (any version should do) and importantly the [tmsi interface](https://www.tmsi.com/news/recent-news/62-matlab)

I made some of the comments long after I wrote the script, but maybe it's helpful to anyone!
